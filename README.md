# foxfiles
Dotfiles for i3wm on Arch Linux, using Polybar, Rofi, Kitty, Pywal, and Qutebrowser. There is a script, movefiles.sh, that will move new configs to their respective locations, and make backups of the old configs. I am very selfish and this is only written for me, sorry! (I am not sorry) These are still unfinished, but the idea of having my own git repository is too shiny to ignore? 

As for dependancies, I don't really feel like combing through every file to see what is needed (I am very selfish), but I know you at least need: 
- Envy Code R Nerd Font
- bc
- jq
- ummm you can figure it out?
